# OricAtmost_Mister

This is my attempt at getting the Mister Oric Code to read a tape input through the ADC input on the Mister. The ADC input is used on the ZX Spectrum core very well. Currently this code is not functional for tape loading, but still functions in the way the previous implementation did. Full credit goes to the original authors for this code, I have really done nothing to better it at this point.
